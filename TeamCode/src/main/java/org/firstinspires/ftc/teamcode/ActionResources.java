 * This class is used to define blocking resources that actions might access.
 * An action is allowed to specify which resources it requires, and when a new action is scheduled,
 * all actions that were using those resources will be terminated.
 *
 * Please name resources in a way that makes their intended purpose clear!
 * Good resource name examples: VERTICAL_ELEVATOR_RESOURCE,  CLAW_RESOURCE, etc.
 * Bad resource name examples: UPPER_SUBSYSTEM_RESOURCE (too vague), CLAW_AND_ARM_RESOURCE (should be two separate resources)
